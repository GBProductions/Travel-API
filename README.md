#### By **Garrett P. Brown, Ophelia Swen**

### User Stories
- [x] As a user, I want to GET and POST reviews about travel destinations.
- [X] As a user, I want to GET reviews by country or city.
- [x] As a user, I want to see the most popular travel destinations by number of reviews or by overall rating.
- [x] As a user, I want to PUT and DELETE reviews, but only if I wrote them. (Start by requiring a user_name param to match the user_name of the author on the message. You can always try authentication later.)
- [x] As a user, I want to look up random destinations just for fun.
